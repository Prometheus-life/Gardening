# Gardening

This is a project focused on lowest possible marginal cost for gardens. Focusing on geophonics, hydrophonics, aerophonics and their associated efficiencies. 

## Geophonics

Geophonics is the most basic form of agriculture. It uses soil as a medium and is the most wasteful form of resources. It typically requires higher maintenance for weed removal, the most water usage and the largest usage of land for productivity.

## Hydrophonics

Hydrophonics removes the soil medium and uses a nutrient based liquid to provide sustenance for the plants. This typically requires maintenance in the form of ensuring that the roots of the plants don't become oversoaked in water and need dry time for healthy roots.

## Aerophonics

Aerophonics is a subset of hydrophonics that will use misters or drippers to provide the nutrient liquid to the roots of the plant. With the right automation, this form of agriculture will provide the highest yield while providing little need for maintenance.
