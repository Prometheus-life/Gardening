# Gardening

This is a project focused on lowest possible marginal cost for gardens. Focusing on geophonics, hydrophonics, aerophonics and their associated efficiencies. 

## Geophonics

Geophonics is the most basic form of agriculture. It uses soil as a medium and is the most wasteful form of resources. It typically requires higher maintenance for weed removal, the most water usage and the largest usage of land for productivity.

## Hydrophonics

## Aerophonics
